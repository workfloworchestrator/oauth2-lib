This Project contains a Mixin class that wraps an openapi-codegen python client, to inject Opentelemetry spans
and api call retries. It also contains a number of FastAPI dependencies which enables Policy enforcement offloading
to Open Policy Agent.

The project contains a number of OIDC classes that are tailored to the SURF environment.

## Supported Python versions

oauth2-lib must support the same python versions as [orchestrator-core](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/orchestrator-core).

Exceptions to this rule are:
* **A new python version is released:** oauth2-lib should support the new version before orchestrator-core does
* **Support for an old python version is dropped:** oauth2-lib should drop the python version after orchestrator-core does
